# ln(Peas)

### Pea Pods

Jady Lei and Benjamin Lim

### Project Description:

We are rewriting linPeas, which is a tool used to locate (privilege escalation) vulnerabilities on a device. Since many of the commands used in scanning for privilege escalation vectors are the same each time, this script runs those commands for you and highlights areas of importance.

### Instructions:

The user can install the program by copying the script `lnpeas.sh` from this repository. Once installed, running `bash lnpeas.sh` will run the script and start searching for vulnerabilities.  

If desired, specific modules can be omitted by commenting out sections (adding "#" to the beginning of lines) at the bottom of the script.

Notes: I, Jady Lei, didn't remember cameras until 90 minutes of editing had already passed. I'm not refilming and editing the video. The volume may be a bit low, but I put in effort to balance the volume for most of the video. It is also a little low quality, but all the text is still legible.
